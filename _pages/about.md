Hi, welcome to our teamblog! :laughing:

GoGL is a team of three graduate students at the Department of Statistics & Data Science, Yonsei Univerrsity. Our main reserach areas include variational inference(VI), bayesian computing, spatio-temporal data analysis, functional data analysis, and more...bayesian stuff. However, we also enjoy exploring new ideas in the big statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence world. We created this blog to keep track of our studies and projects. Our goal is to tackle any interesting topics in the field of data science & AI.

Our first project is the **Recommendation System**. [Brunch](https://brunch.co.kr/) dataset from [KaKao Arena](https://arena.kakao.com/c/6) will be used. We plan to finish this project by March.
